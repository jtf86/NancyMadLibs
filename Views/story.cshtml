<h1>A fantastical adventure</h1>
<p>One day, @Model.Person1 and @Model.Person2 were walking through the woods,
when suddenly a giant @Model.Animal appeared. "@Model.Exclamation!"
@Model.Person1 cried. The two of them @Model.Verb as quickly as possible,
and when they were safe, @Model.Person1 and @Model.Person2 gave each other a giant @Model.Noun.</p>

@if (@Model.Person1 != "John")
{
  <h2>John is not in this story!</h2>
}
